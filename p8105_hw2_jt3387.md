## Problem 1

Read and clean the New York transit subway data.

``` r
nyc_transit <- read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
                        col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:ada, -c(exit_only, staffing, staff_hours)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

A brief description of the data:

-   The resulting dataset contains `1868` rows and `19` columns. The
    data set contains the following variables: *line*, *station_name*,
    *station_latitude*, *station_longitude*, *route1* to *route11*,
    *entrance_type*, *entry*, *vending*, and *ada*.

-   The data cleaning steps: I firstly read the data set using
    `read_csv`, and clean the names with `clean_name` function. Then I
    use `select` to choose the variables I need, and convert the entry
    variable from character (YES and NO) to a logical variable(TRUE and
    FALSE) using `recode`.

-   I think these datas are not tidy, as the route information can still
    be integrated and simplified and other variables like *entry* and
    *vending* with values of Yes and No can also be converted to logical
    variables.

Quantitative analysis of the variables.

``` r
dis_station <- nyc_transit %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line)
nrow(dis_station)
```

    ## [1] 465

``` r
dis_station_ada <- nyc_transit %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line)
nrow(dis_station_ada)
```

    ## [1] 84

``` r
nyc_transit_entry <- nyc_transit %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry)
mean(nyc_transit_entry)
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

-   There are 465 distinct stations, and 84 stations are ADA compliant.
    Around 37.7% of station entrances/exits without vending allow
    entrance.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
nyc_transit_A <- nyc_transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name",
    values_drop_na = T) %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line, .keep_all = TRUE)
nrow(nyc_transit_A)
```

    ## [1] 60

``` r
nyc_transit_A_ada <- filter(nyc_transit_A, ada == TRUE)
nrow(nyc_transit_A_ada)
```

    ## [1] 17

-   60 distinct stations serve the A train, of which, 17 stations are
    ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet and Professor Trash Wheel data.

``` r
mr_trash <- read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                       sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N550") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)),
         year = as.numeric(year)) 

prof_trash <- read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M97") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) 
```

Add an additional variable *trash_wheel_type* to both data set and
combine them.

``` r
mr_trash <- mutate(mr_trash, trash_wheel_type = "Mr Trash Wheel")
prof_trash <- mutate(prof_trash, trash_wheel_type = "Professor Trash Wheel")
merge_trash <- bind_rows(mr_trash, prof_trash)
```

A brief description of the data:

-   There are 15 variables and 641 observations.

-   Some examples of key variables: *dumpster* shows the ID of the
    trash; *month*, *year*, *date* variables represent the time when the
    trash was collected. *weight_tons* and *volume_cubic_yards*
    represent the mass and volume of the trash; *plastic_bottle*,
    *polystyrene*, *cigarette_butt*, *glass_bottle*, *grocery_bag*,
    *chip_bag* and *sport_ball* shows the amount of different kinds of
    trash in every dumpster. *homes_powered* represents how many homes
    the dumpster powered; and *trash_wheel_type* indicates whether it’s
    collected by Mr. Trash Wheel or Professor Trash Wheel.

Quantitative analysis of the variables.

``` r
prof_trash_sum <- merge_trash %>% 
  filter(trash_wheel_type == "Professor Trash Wheel") %>% 
  select(weight_tons) %>% 
  sum()
prof_trash_sum
```

    ## [1] 190.12

``` r
mr_spor_2020_sum <- merge_trash %>% 
  filter(trash_wheel_type == "Mr Trash Wheel", year == "2020") %>% 
  select(sports_balls) %>% 
  sum()
mr_spor_2020_sum
```

    ## [1] 856

-   The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is
    190.12 tons and the total number of sports balls collected by
    Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856.

## Problem 3

Read and clean the pols-month data.

``` r
pols <- read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day"), sep = '-') %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         month = month.name[as.numeric(month)], 
         president = recode(prez_dem, `0` = "gop", `1` = "dem")) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day)) %>% 
  relocate(year, month, president)
```

Read and clean the snp and unemployment data.

``` r
snp <- read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         month = month.name[as.numeric(month)],
         year_pref = ifelse(year < 50, 2000, 1900), 
         year = year_pref + year) %>% 
  select(year, month, close) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)

unemployment <- read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(jan:dec,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "umemploy_number")
```

Merge three data sets.

``` r
merge_data <- left_join(pols, snp) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment) 
```

Result interpretation:

-   The `pols-month` dataset contains `822` rows and `9` columns. This
    dataset shows the number of national politicians who are democratic
    or republican and whether the president was republican or democratic
    on the associated date. The `snp` dataset contains `787` rows and
    `3` columns. This dataset includes the closing values of the S&P
    stock index on the associated date. The `unemployment` dataset
    contains `816` rows and `3` columns and it indicates the percentage
    of unemployment in different months of the associated year

-   The resulting dataset contains `822` rows and `11` columns. The
    range of year is 1947 to 2015 and names of key variables are:
    *year*, *month*, *president*, *gov_gop*,*sen_gop*, *rep_gop*,
    *gov_dem*, *sen_dem*,*rep_dem*, *close*, *number_umemploy*.
