## Problem 1

Read and clean the New York transit subway data.

``` r
nyc_transit <- read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
                        col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:ada, -c(exit_only, staffing, staff_hours)) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

A brief description of the data:

-   The resulting dataset contains `1868` rows and `19` columns. The
    dataset contains the following variables: *line*, *station_name*,
    *station_latitude*, *station_longitude*, *route1* to *route11*,
    *entrance_type*, *entry*, *vending*, and *ada*.

-   The data cleaning steps: I firstly read the dataset using
    `read_csv`, and clean the names with `clean_name` function. Then I
    use `select` to choose the variables I need, after that I convert
    the entry variable from character (YES and NO) to a logical
    variable(TRUE and FALSE) using `recode`.

-   I think these datas are not tidy, as the route information can still
    be integrated and simplified and other variables like `entry` and
    `vending` with values of Yes and No can also be converted to logical
    variables.

Quantitative analysis of the variables.

``` r
dis_station <- nyc_transit %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line)
nrow(dis_station)
```

    ## [1] 465

-   There are 465 distinct stations.

``` r
dis_station_ada <- nyc_transit %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line)
nrow(dis_station_ada)
```

    ## [1] 84

-   84 stations are ADA compliant.

``` r
nyc_transit_entry = nyc_transit %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry)
mean(nyc_transit_entry)
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

-   Around 37.7% of station entrances/exits without vending allow
    entrance.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
nyc_transit_A <- nyc_transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name",
    values_drop_na = T) %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A") %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line, .keep_all = TRUE)
nrow(nyc_transit_A)
```

    ## [1] 60

-   60 distinct stations serve the A train.

``` r
nyc_transit_A_ada <- nyc_transit_A %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE)
nrow(nyc_transit_A_ada)
```

    ## [1] 17

-   Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 stations are ADA
    compliant.
